# Election-Poll
 Election Poll Data Analysis  In this project, we'll look at the opinion poll data from the 2016 General Election. In the process, we'll try to answer the following questions:  - Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation? - Did the poll results favour Clinton or Trump? - How did voter sentiment change over time? - Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
